  <p><span class="float-left"><img src="media/kindness1.jpg" alt="" /></span>Let's face it. Even before the recent collapse of the global economy, our economic system was not contributing to the promotion of peace, sustainability, or balance in the world. In recent years, it has produced wars over oil resources, global warming, poverty, pollution, famine, widespread extinction of species. increases in cancer, and growing rates of unemployment, underemployment, and unfulfilling employment.</p>
  <p>Many communities around the world are responding to these trends by <a href="http://www.smallisbeautiful.org/local_currencies/currency_groups.html" target="_blank">creating their own complementary economies--including their own local currency</a>. These economies are not intended to replace the global economy but to offer a more humane and productive counterpoint to the existing economic structure.</p>

  <p>In Tucson, Arizona, we are building a new locally-based economy and a <strong>Tucson Local Currecy (TLC) </strong>that is intended to create:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Community. Our currency stays in Tucson and is re-invested in our community rather than ending up in another part of the world.</li>
    <li>Sustainability. We promote products that are made or grown locally, that reuse and recyle existing materials, that rely on natural rather thanartificial components, and that minimize our overall carbon footprint.</li>
    <li>Opportunity. Our educational and promotional efforts encourage local entrepreneurs to offer products and services that are needed in our community and that allow these individuals to supplement their existing income. </li>

    <li>Justice. We create a direct distribution system that allows venders, producers and service providers to receive fair compensation while providing their goods and services to local customers at reasonable prices.</li>
    <li>Stability. By making sure that local suppliers are meeting as many local consumer needs as possible, we create a steady market for local goods and services that is relatively immune to fluctuations in the global economic system.</li>
    <li>Humane Commerce. By doing business with our local friends and neighbors,we foster an economic climate that is based on trust, integrity, kindness and compassion.</li>
    <li>Pride. We support each other in ways that build pride in ourselves and our community, and we invest our time, money and other resources into the improvement of our city and its neighborhoods.</li>
  </ul>
